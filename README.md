Hello, I am iRKenshin, I started this account to aid in furthering my knowledge of the Python programming language and any other language I learn in betwee
n. I hope to become an expert in Python, and proficient at the necessary math to get a job. I hope to go back to school for computer science soon. I want 
to use my skills in python and math to transfer over to a job in data.
